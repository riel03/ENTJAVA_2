<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
<h3>Scene 3 - The Diary</h3>
<canvas id="anicanvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
<p>Dana to go down into the basement. She does and the rest of them follow. 
There is a ton of really strange stuff down there. 
Every one pickup a stuff Dana picks up a diary. Curt chooses a puzzle ball and tries to open it. 
Jules likes a wedding dress and starts to put on the necklace that goes with it. 
Marty is looking at a conch shell and Holden is mesmerized by a child's jewelry box that opens to reveal a dancing ballerina when, all of a sudden...
...Dana says "Hey guys! Listen to this.

Everyone else puts down what they were looking at and walks over to her. 
The diary belonged to a young girl who was brutally beaten by her father. 
There is something about how they will all return once someone reads some Latin words at the end of the diary. 
Marty says they shouldn't read it. He hears a voice tell Dana to read it. 
No one else seems to hear it. Against the advice of Marty, Dana reads the Latin and somewhere outside, the family from the diary returns from their graves all zombie-fied.
